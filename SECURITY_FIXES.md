# Security Vulnerabilities and Bug Fixes

## Overview
This document details the security vulnerabilities, logic errors, and performance issues identified and fixed in the LLM Evaluation System codebase.

## Critical Security Vulnerabilities Fixed

### 1. **CRITICAL: Plain Text Password Comparison**
- **File:** `utils/auth.py:66`
- **Severity:** HIGH
- **Issue:** Admin passwords were compared in plain text, making them vulnerable to interception and exposure.
- **Fix:** Implemented secure password hashing with SHA-256 and salt. Added backward compatibility for existing plain text passwords with deprecation warning.
- **Impact:** Prevents password exposure and strengthens authentication security.

### 2. **HIGH: Weak Email Validation**
- **Files:** `utils/data_store.py:595, 635`
- **Severity:** MEDIUM-HIGH
- **Issue:** Email validation only checked for presence of '@' and '.' characters, easily bypassed.
- **Fix:** Implemented RFC 5322 compliant email validation using robust regex patterns.
- **Impact:** Prevents injection attacks and ensures valid email addresses.

### 3. **MEDIUM: Information Disclosure in Error Messages**
- **Files:** `pages/blind_evaluation.py:57-58`, `utils/llm_clients.py:149`
- **Severity:** MEDIUM
- **Issue:** Debug information and detailed error messages exposed system structure and sensitive information.
- **Fix:** Replaced debug output with proper logging and sanitized error messages for users.
- **Impact:** Prevents information leakage that could aid attackers.

### 4. **MEDIUM: Path Traversal Vulnerability**
- **File:** `utils/data_store.py:242`
- **Severity:** MEDIUM
- **Issue:** File paths constructed without validation, potentially allowing directory traversal attacks.
- **Fix:** Added path normalization and validation to ensure files stay within allowed directories.
- **Impact:** Prevents unauthorized file access and directory traversal attacks.

## Logic and Performance Issues Fixed

### 5. **Logic Error: Bare Exception Handling**
- **File:** `utils/question_generator.py:47`
- **Severity:** MEDIUM
- **Issue:** Bare `except:` clause could mask serious errors and make debugging difficult.
- **Fix:** Replaced with specific exception types (ValueError, TypeError, AttributeError).
- **Impact:** Improves error handling and debugging capabilities.

### 6. **Performance Issue: Inefficient CSV File Handling**
- **File:** `batch_evaluator.py:179-192`
- **Severity:** MEDIUM
- **Issue:** Loading entire CSV file into memory for each append operation is inefficient for large files.
- **Fix:** Implemented direct append mode for CSV operations without loading entire file.
- **Impact:** Reduces memory usage and improves performance for large datasets.

### 7. **Memory Leak: Uncontrolled Session State Growth**
- **File:** `app.py:29`
- **Severity:** MEDIUM
- **Issue:** Session state grows indefinitely without cleanup, causing memory issues over time.
- **Fix:** Added automatic cleanup of old registration data (>24 hours) that haven't completed evaluation.
- **Impact:** Prevents memory leaks and improves application stability.

## Security Enhancements Added

### 8. **New Security Configuration Module**
- **File:** `utils/security_config.py` (NEW)
- **Purpose:** Centralized security configuration and utilities
- **Features:**
  - Robust email validation
  - Filename sanitization
  - Path validation utilities
  - Secure password hashing
  - Error message sanitization
  - Security event logging
  - Configurable security parameters

## Recommendations for Further Security Improvements

### 1. **Implement Rate Limiting**
```python
# Add to security_config.py
@staticmethod
def check_rate_limit(user_ip: str, action: str) -> bool:
    # Implement Redis or in-memory rate limiting
    pass
```

### 2. **Add Input Sanitization**
- Sanitize all user inputs before processing
- Implement content security policies
- Add CSRF protection for forms

### 3. **Enhanced Authentication**
- Implement multi-factor authentication
- Add password complexity requirements
- Session rotation and timeout

### 4. **Data Protection**
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Implement data retention policies
- Add audit logging for all data access

### 5. **API Security**
- Implement proper API authentication
- Add request/response validation
- Use HTTPS for all communications

## Testing Recommendations

### Security Testing
1. Run penetration testing on authentication mechanisms
2. Test for SQL injection vulnerabilities
3. Verify path traversal protections
4. Test rate limiting effectiveness

### Performance Testing
1. Load test with large CSV files
2. Memory usage monitoring over extended sessions
3. Concurrent user testing

## Monitoring and Alerting
