However, the provided data lacks the total number of transactions for each category. Therefore, I'm unable to provide the exact average sales per product in each category.\n\nHere's a summary of the transaction data for each category:\n- Accessories (Chunks 2 & 4): Total Sales = $71 (for Customer 1472) + $34 (for Customer 2107) = $105, Number of Transactions = 2\n- Clothing (Chunks 3, 5, & 6): Total Sales = $64 (for Customer 334) + $77 (for Customer 156) + $33 (for Customer 1930) = $174, Number of Transactions = 3\n\nPlease note that this is not the average sales per product, as there are multiple items (different products) in each category. Also, the average sales per product would require knowing the price of each individual product in each transaction. The given data only provides the total sales for each transaction.\n\nIf you have more detailed data, like the number of transactions and the individual product prices, I could help you calculate the average sales per product in each category.\n\nFor now, I would recommend looking into more comprehensive data to accurately determine the average sales per product.\n\n[Relevant Chunks: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]",
