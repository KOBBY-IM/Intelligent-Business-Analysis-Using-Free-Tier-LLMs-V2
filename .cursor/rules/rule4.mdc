Title: Blind Evaluation Interface Rule — Streamlit Page Logic

Applies to: Streamlit Human Feedback Tasks

Rule:
You are building or modifying the **human evaluation interface** for blind testing of LLM responses. This UI component is security-sensitive and evaluator-facing.

1. Tester Identity Rules  
• Require user name and email input.  
• Validate email is unique (no duplicate submissions allowed).  
• Store timestamped consent with email and name.  
• Use Streamlit session state to cache input before form submission.

2. LLM Response Presentation  
• Load pregenerated questions + answers.  
• Randomize answer order for each session.  
• Obscure LLM identity on-screen and in form fields.

3. Feedback Collection  
• Collect numerical ratings for relevance, clarity, accuracy, etc.  
• Collect optional free-text comments.  
• Save all data as JSON or CSV with fields:  
 – Tester metadata  
 – Question ID  
 – Ratings per LLM  
 – Qualitative comments  
 – Timestamps

4. Access Gate  
• Restrict page behind passphrase from Streamlit secrets (external testers only).  
• Show clear "access denied" message if auth fails.  
• Never allow anonymous submissions.

5. No Live Querying  
• Do not call LLMs during tester sessions.  
• Responses must be pregenerated and static.

Every submission must be trustworthy, auditable, and linked to a single tester.
