# Streamlit Cloud Deployment Checklist

## ‚úÖ Pre-Deployment Verification

### Essential Files Present
- [x] `app.py` - Main Streamlit application
- [x] `pages/blind_evaluation.py` - Blind evaluation page
- [x] `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- [x] `data/eval_questions.json` - Evaluation questions
- [x] `data/pregenerated_responses.json` - Sample LLM responses
- [x] `data/Tesla_stock_data.csv` - Sample finance dataset
- [x] `data/shopping_trends.csv` - Sample retail dataset
- [x] `utils/` - All utility modules
- [x] `tests/` - Test files

### Key Features Verified
- [x] Tester registration with consent
- [x] Ground truth context for evaluation questions
- [x] Blind evaluation with anonymous responses
- [x] Sequential question flow (6 per industry)
- [x] Data persistence and collection
- [x] Access control and security

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. Connect to Streamlit Cloud
1. Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Click "New app"
4. Select repository: `KOBBY-IM/Intelligent-Business-Analysis-Using-Free-Tier-LLMs-V2`
5. Set main file path: `app.py`
6. Click "Deploy"

### 2. Configuration (if needed)
- **Secrets**: Currently using sample data, no external API keys required
- **Environment**: Python 3.9+ (handled by requirements.txt)
- **Resources**: Free tier should be sufficient

### 3. Post-Deployment Testing
- [ ] Test registration flow
- [ ] Verify ground truth context displays
- [ ] Test blind evaluation with sample responses
- [ ] Check data persistence
- [ ] Verify navigation between pages

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Missing Data Files**: All essential data files are now included in the repository
2. **Import Errors**: All dependencies are in requirements.txt
3. **Path Issues**: Using relative paths compatible with Streamlit Cloud
4. **Session State**: Properly configured for Streamlit Cloud environment

### Error Resolution
- If data loading fails, check that all JSON/CSV files are present
- If imports fail, verify requirements.txt is complete
- If session state issues occur, restart the app

## üìä Expected Behavior

### Registration Page
- Users can register with email and name
- Consent checkbox required
- Prevents duplicate registrations
- Allows continuation of incomplete evaluations

### Blind Evaluation Page
- Shows ground truth context for each question
- Displays 4 anonymous responses (A, B, C, D)
- Collects ratings and comments
- Sequential flow through 6 questions per industry
- Progress tracking and completion status

### Data Collection
- Evaluations saved to `data/evaluations.json`
- Registrations saved to `data/registrations.json`
- Proper error handling and user feedback

## üéØ Success Criteria
- [ ] App deploys without errors
- [ ] Registration flow works end-to-end
- [ ] Blind evaluation displays ground truth and responses
- [ ] Data is properly collected and stored
- [ ] User experience is smooth and intuitive

## üìù Notes
- Ground truth context provides factual information for better evaluation quality
- Sample responses are realistic and varied across different LLM providers
- All data files are now properly tracked in git and will be available on Streamlit Cloud
- The application is designed to work entirely with sample data for demonstration purposes
