# 🔄 Session Persistence Improvements

## ❌ **Problem Fixed:**
- Page refresh was clearing user data and resetting to homepage
- Users lost their current page selection after refresh
- Testers were always redirected to Blind Evaluation on every page load
- Poor user experience with data loss

## ✅ **Improvements Implemented:**

### 1. **Persistent Page Selection**
- Current page selection is now stored in `st.session_state["current_page"]`
- Page selection persists across browser refreshes
- Users stay on their selected page after refresh

### 2. **Smart Auto-Redirect for Testers**
- Testers are auto-redirected to "Blind Evaluation" **only on first login**
- After initial redirect, testers can navigate freely without forced redirects
- Page preference is remembered across sessions

### 3. **Session State Initialization**
- Added `init_session_state()` function to ensure consistent session state
- Prevents undefined session state errors
- Initializes all required session variables on app startup

### 4. **Enhanced Session Management**
- Authentication state persists across page refreshes
- Registration data remains intact after refresh
- User email and role information maintained

### 5. **Session State Debugging**
- Added detailed session information to "System Status" page
- Shows current authentication status, page, and registration data
- Debugging tools to verify session persistence

## 🧪 **How to Test the Improvements:**

### **Test 1: Page Persistence**
1. Login as tester (`EvalTester2025`)
2. Navigate to any page (e.g., "System Status")
3. **Refresh the browser** (F5 or Ctrl+R)
4. ✅ **Expected**: You stay on the same page, remain logged in

### **Test 2: Registration Data Persistence**
1. Login as tester with new email
2. Complete registration form
3. **Refresh the browser**
4. ✅ **Expected**: Registration data is preserved, no need to re-register

### **Test 3: Smart Auto-Redirect**
1. **First login**: Tester is auto-redirected to "Blind Evaluation"
2. Navigate to "System Status" 
3. **Refresh browser**
4. ✅ **Expected**: Stay on "System Status", no forced redirect

### **Test 4: Authentication Persistence**
1. Login as admin (`Root_Blamlez`)
2. Navigate to "Admin Panel"
3. **Refresh browser**
4. ✅ **Expected**: Remain logged in as admin, stay on Admin Panel

### **Test 5: Session State Verification**
1. Navigate to "System Status" page
2. Check the "Session State Status" section
3. ✅ **Expected**: See current authentication, page, and session data
4. Optional: Check "Show detailed session state" for debugging

## 🔍 **Debug Information Available:**

On the **System Status** page, you can now see:
- ✅ Current authentication status and user role
- ✅ Current page selection
- ✅ Number of registered testers
- ✅ Active session state keys
- ✅ Detailed session state (optional debug view)

## 🚀 **Benefits:**

1. **No More Data Loss**: User data persists across page refreshes
2. **Better UX**: Users stay where they were after refresh
3. **Smarter Navigation**: Auto-redirect only when needed
4. **Debugging Tools**: Easy troubleshooting of session issues
5. **Consistent State**: Reliable session management across the app

## ⚠️ **Important Notes:**

- **Logout still clears everything**: This is intentional for security
- **Session data is browser-specific**: Different browsers = different sessions
- **Registration data persists**: Until explicitly cleared by admin or logout
- **Page preferences remembered**: Until logout or session expiry
